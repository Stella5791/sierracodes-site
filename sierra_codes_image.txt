/images/sierra-codes-og.png

You’ve now got the Open Graph preview image reference set. To complete it:

1. Place the actual `sierra-codes-og.png` image (1200×630px) inside your `/images/` folder.
2. Double‑check the `<head>` of your Sierra Codes HTML includes the OG and Twitter card tags pointing here.
3. Test with LinkedIn’s Post Inspector or Twitter’s Card Validator to see the preview card live.

Do you want me to also prepare smaller versions (favicon 32×32, apple‑touch 180×180, etc.) so your hill logo is consistent across tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screens?
